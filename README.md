# *Battleship Game - Player vs Player and Player vs Bot*

## Description
A modern implementation of the Battleship game built using C. This version features both Player vs Player and Player vs Bot modes. The game includes a bot with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Players take turns placing ships on a grid and firing at each other's ships, aiming to sink all the opponent's vessels. The bot adapts its strategy based on the selected difficulty, making the game more challenging with each level.

## Features
- *Two Game Modes*:  
  - *Player vs Player*: Play against a friend on the same machine.
  - *Player vs Bot Mode: Challenge a bot with three levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, and Hard), each offering a progressively more strategic and intelligent opponent.

  - *Modular Code Structure*: The code is organized into modules for better maintainability and scalability.

  - *Precompiled Executables*: Easily run the game without needing to recompile the code, using precompiled executables for quick testing.

  - *Version Control*: The project is integrated with Git for version control, making it easy to manage and collaborate.

  - *Development Environment*: Configured for Visual Studio Code for optimal development.

## Technologies Used
- *C Language*: The game logic and bot are implemented in C.
- *GCC or any compatible C compiler*: For compiling the source code.
